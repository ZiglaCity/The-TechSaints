            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                <b>The TechSaints</b> was founded by two passionate individuals, Edwin(EGO) and MySelf(Zigla), during our time in high school. What started as a small idea to create tech solutions has now grown into a brand focused on bringing innovative technology to businesses and individuals around the world.
                In high school, we spent countless hours brainstorming, building projects, and learning from each other. Our friendship, along with our shared passion for technology, led us to start a company that could make an impact. From small coding projects to launching new digital services, we’ve continuously worked together to build something meaningful.
